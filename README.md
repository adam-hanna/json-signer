# amino-signer

Sign any cosmos transaction using the amino-json sign mode.

Usage:
```
$ amino-signer sign-tx --from=my-key --keyring-dir=~/.gaia --account=42 --sequence=43 --chain-id=cosmoshub-4 tx.json
```

Where `tx.json` is the file generated by the blockchain binary with the
`--generate-only` flag.


## Why amino-json

Amino-json allows to build the bytes-to-sign without the needs for protobuf
types registrations.

For example, this transaction is easy to translate to amino-json bytes-to-sign,
while it's impossible with the direct sign-mode because it requires the
`MsgSend` proto generated type to be available.

## Keyring

`amino-signer` also uses a alternate keyring package that is able to read a
keyring (only file backend for now), whether it was been created with a
cosmos-sdk application version <0.46 (amino encoded key), or with version >=0.46
(proto encoded key). And of course it doesn't automatically migrate amino
encoded keys to proto keys like cosmos-sdk applications >=0.46 does.
